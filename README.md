# An AMR-Wind tutorial
A guide for new AMR-Wind users, adapted from work by Alex Rybchuk. After going through this guide, you should be able to run an LES simulation of a small wind farm in a weakly convective atmospheric boundary layer.

This guide is focused on the applications that AMR-Wind is most often used for: atmospheric boundary layers, actuator models of turbines, and coupling with OpenFAST. This guide does not yet detail two-phase wave simulations or overset coupling to another flow solver.
